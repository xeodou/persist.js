*Still working on it*

### How it works

Persist.js can cache the result in the storage for any tasks, the storage can be a [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [indexdb](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) or any storage you want use.
